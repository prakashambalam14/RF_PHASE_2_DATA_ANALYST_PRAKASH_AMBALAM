## ✅ Practical Task 1: Business Dataset Analysis Report

Dataset: Video Game Sales Dataset
Role: Data Analyst Intern
Tools Used: Google Colab

📁 **Notebook:** `PYTHON PRACTICAL`

### Steps Performed

- Data Cleaning
- Handling Missing Values
- Removing Duplicate Records
- Business Question Analysis

🧹 Data Cleaning Summary

Several preprocessing steps were applied before analysis:

Duplicate records were checked and removed
Sales columns missing values were filled with 0 (interpreted as no recorded sales)
Missing developer names were filled with “Unknown”
Critic scores were imputed using the median score to avoid data loss
Date columns were converted to datetime format, and missing dates were preserved as null rather than artificially filled
These steps ensured data consistency while preserving maximum usable records.

### Business Questions Answered

1️⃣ Which video games have generated the highest total sales across all consoles?

2️⃣ Which game genres contribute the most to total global sales?

3️⃣ Which gaming consoles have produced the highest overall sales revenue?

4️⃣ Which publishers dominate the market in terms of total game sales?

6️⃣ How does genre performance vary across different regions (NA, JP, PAL, Other)?


✅ Business Conclusion

The analysis shows that commercial success in the video game industry is primarily driven by franchise strength, genre category, publisher scale, and multi-platform availability rather than critic scores alone. Companies should prioritize cross-platform releases and high-performing genres while adapting strategies by region.
