📊 Data Analytics Internship — Rashid Foundation
📅 Week 1 Progress Report (Basic Level Tasks)

This repository documents my learning and practical work completed during the first 9–10 days of my internship under Rashid Foundation as part of the Data Analytics Internship Program.

The focus of this phase was to build strong fundamentals across tools, concepts, and real-world analytics workflows.

🔍 Overview of Week 1

During this period, I worked on understanding job roles in data analytics, learning core tools, practicing data cleaning, building dashboards, and studying important statistical and machine learning concepts.

This phase mainly covered basic to beginner-level tasks to prepare for intermediate-level project work starting from 26 January.
